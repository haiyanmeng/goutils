66. Plus One 
Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, plus one to the number.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

Analysis:
question: decimal or octal or hexadecimal

first we should go to check the last digit D, whether D < 9:
if D < 9, then directly add 1 to D, return.

If D == 9, then change D to 0, and try to add 1 to the second last digit. Notice the case, an extra 1 is needed.
Like 4->1->2->9, the result should be 4->1->3->0.
Like 9->9, the result should be 1->0->0.
Time O(n^2); space O(1)

We can also use another pointer to keep track the first digit M we met whose value is < 9, if D== 9, then we can just directly add 1 to M, and change the remaining value to be 0.
Time O(n); space O(1)
